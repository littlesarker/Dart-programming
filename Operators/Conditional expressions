Conditional expressions

Dart has two operators that let you concisely evaluate expressions that might otherwise require if-else statements:

condition ? expr1 : expr2
    If condition is true, evaluates expr1 (and returns its value); otherwise, 
    evaluates and returns the value of expr2.

expr1 ?? expr2
    If expr1 is non-null, returns its value; otherwise, 
    evaluates and returns the value of expr2.
