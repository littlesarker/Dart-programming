Cascade notation

Cascades (.., ?..) allow you to make a sequence of operations on the same object. 
In addition to accessing instance members, you can also call instance methods on that same object.
This often saves you the step of creating a temporary variable and allows you to write more fluid code.



var paint = Paint()
  ..color = Colors.black
  ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
  ..strokeWidth = 5.0;



above example 
example is equivalent to this code:

var paint = Paint();
 paint.color = Colors.black;
 paint.strokeCap = StrokeCap.round;
 paint.strokeWidth = 5.0;
